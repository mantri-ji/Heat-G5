This project involved adding accessibility features to the HEAT IDE software to make it more accessible for people with severe visual impairments. 
To achieve this goal we successfully implemented new features to the GUI, including:

•TTS [text-to-speech] 

•Newer Large Icons and Text

•Magnifying Mode

•Splash screen for togglinh between Normal and Accessibility Mode 


For an efficient development process, we decided to organise our approach to the project around an Agile methodology, specifically Scrum while using project management service like JIRA.
